## Keras preprocessing layers

The Keras preprocessing layers API allows developers to build Keras-native input
processing pipelines. These input processing pipelines can be used as independent
preprocessing code in non-Keras workflows, combined directly with Keras models, and
exported as part of a Keras SavedModel.

With Keras preprocessing layers, you can build and export models that are truly
end-to-end: models that accept raw images or raw structured data as input; models that
handle feature normalization or feature value indexing on their own.

---
## Available preprocessing layers

### Core preprocessing layers

- `TextVectorization` layer: turns raw strings into an encoded representation that can be
read by an `Embedding` layer or `Dense` layer.
- `Normalization` layer: performs feature-wise normalize of input features.

### Structured data preprocessing layers

These layers are for structured data encoding and feature engineering.

- `CategoryEncoding` layer: turns integer categorical features into one-hot, multi-hot,
or TF-IDF dense representations.
- `Hashing` layer: performs categorical feature hashing, also known as the "hashing
trick".
- `Discretization` layer: turns continuous numerical features into integer categorical
features.
- `StringLookup` layer: turns string categorical values into integers indices.
- `IntegerLookup` layer: turns integer categorical values into integers indices.
- `CategoryCrossing` layer: combines categorical features into co-occurrence features.
E.g. if you have feature values "a" and "b", it can provide with the combination feature
"a and b are present at the same time".

### Image preprocessing layers

These layers are for standardizing the inputs of an image model.

- `Resizing` layer: resizes a batch of images to a target size.
- `Rescaling` layer: rescales and offsets the values of a batch of image (e.g. go from
inputs in the `[0, 255]` range to inputs in the `[0, 1]` range.
- `CenterCrop` layer: returns a center crop of a batch of images.

### Image data augmentation layers

These layers apply random augmentation transforms to a batch of images. They
are only active during training.

- `RandomCrop` layer
- `RandomFlip` layer
- `RandomTranslation` layer
- `RandomRotation` layer
- `RandomZoom` layer
- `RandomHeight` layer
- `RandomWidth` layer

---
## The `adapt()` method

Some preprocessing layers have an internal state that must be computed based on
a sample of the training data. The list of stateful preprocessing layers is:

- `TextVectorization`: holds a mapping between string tokens and integer indices
- `Normalization`: holds the mean and standard deviation of the features
- `StringLookup` and `IntegerLookup`: hold a mapping between input values and output
indices.
- `CategoryEncoding`: holds an index of input values.
- `Discretization`: holds information about value bucket boundaries.

Crucially, these layers are **non-trainable**. Their state is not set during training; it
must be set **before training**, a step called "adaptation".

You set the state of a preprocessing layer by exposing it to training data, via the
`adapt()` method:


```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers.experimental import preprocessing

data = np.array([[0.1, 0.2, 0.3], [0.8, 0.9, 1.0], [1.5, 1.6, 1.7],])
layer = preprocessing.Normalization()
layer.adapt(data)
normalized_data = layer(data)

print("Features mean: %.2f" % (normalized_data.numpy().mean()))
print("Features std: %.2f" % (normalized_data.numpy().std()))
```

<div class="k-default-codeblock">
```
Features mean: 0.00
Features std: 1.00

```
</div>
The `adapt()` method takes either a Numpy array or a `tf.data.Dataset` object. In the
case of `StringLookup` and `TextVectorization`, you can also pass a list of strings:


```python
data = [
    "ξεῖν᾽, ἦ τοι μὲν ὄνειροι ἀμήχανοι ἀκριτόμυθοι",
    "γίγνοντ᾽, οὐδέ τι πάντα τελείεται ἀνθρώποισι.",
    "δοιαὶ γάρ τε πύλαι ἀμενηνῶν εἰσὶν ὀνείρων:",
    "αἱ μὲν γὰρ κεράεσσι τετεύχαται, αἱ δ᾽ ἐλέφαντι:",
    "τῶν οἳ μέν κ᾽ ἔλθωσι διὰ πριστοῦ ἐλέφαντος,",
    "οἵ ῥ᾽ ἐλεφαίρονται, ἔπε᾽ ἀκράαντα φέροντες:",
    "οἱ δὲ διὰ ξεστῶν κεράων ἔλθωσι θύραζε,",
    "οἵ ῥ᾽ ἔτυμα κραίνουσι, βροτῶν ὅτε κέν τις ἴδηται.",
]
layer = preprocessing.TextVectorization()
layer.adapt(data)
vectorized_text = layer(data)
print(vectorized_text)
```

<div class="k-default-codeblock">
```
tf.Tensor(
[[37 12 25  5  9 20 21  0  0]
 [51 34 27 33 29 18  0  0  0]
 [49 52 30 31 19 46 10  0  0]
 [ 7  5 50 43 28  7 47 17  0]
 [24 35 39 40  3  6 32 16  0]
 [ 4  2 15 14 22 23  0  0  0]
 [36 48  6 38 42  3 45  0  0]
 [ 4  2 13 41 53  8 44 26 11]], shape=(8, 9), dtype=int64)

```
</div>
In addition, adaptable layers always expose an option to directly set state via
constructor arguments or weight assignment. If the intended state values are known at
layer construction time, or are calculated outside of the `adapt()` call, they can be set
without relying on the layer's internal computation. For instance, if external vocabulary
files for the `TextVectorization`, `StringLookup`, or `IntegerLookup` layers already
exist, those can be loaded directly into the lookup tables by passing a path to the
vocabulary file in the layer's constructor arguments.

Here's an example where we instantiate a `StringLookup` layer with precomputed vocabulary:


```python
vocab = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
data = tf.constant([["a", "c", "d"], ["d", "z", "b"]])
layer = preprocessing.StringLookup(vocabulary=vocab)
vectorized_data = layer(data)
print(vectorized_data)
```

<div class="k-default-codeblock">
```
tf.Tensor(
[[2 4 5]
 [5 1 3]], shape=(2, 3), dtype=int64)

```
</div>
---
## Preprocessing data before the model or inside the model

There are two ways you could be using preprocessing layers:

**Option 1:** Make them part of the model, like this:

```python
inputs = keras.Input(shape=input_shape)
x = preprocessing_layer(inputs)
outputs = rest_of_the_model(x)
model = keras.Model(inputs, outputs)
```

With this option, preprocessing will happen on device, synchronously with the rest of the
model execution, meaning that it will benefit from GPU acceleration.
If you're training on GPU, this is the best option for the `Normalization` layer, and for
all image preprocessing and data augmentation layers.

**Option 2:** apply it to your `tf.data.Dataset`, so as to obtain a dataset that yields
batches of preprocessed data, like this:

```python
dataset = dataset.map(
  lambda x, y: (preprocessing_layer(x), y))
```

With this option, your preprocessing will happen on CPU, asynchronously, and will be
buffered before going into the model.

This is the best option for `TextVectorization`, and all structured data preprocessing
layers. It can also be a good option if you're training on CPU
and you use image preprocessing layers.

---
## Benefits of doing preprocessing inside the model at inference time

Even if you go with option 2, you may later want to export an inference-only end-to-end
model that will include the preprocessing layers. The key benefit to doing this is that
**it makes your model portable** and it **helps reduce the
[training/serving skew](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/rules-of-ml#training-serving_skew)**.

When all data preprocessing is part of the model, other people can load and use your
model without having to be aware of how each feature is expected to be encoded &
normalized. Your inference model will be able to process raw images or raw structured
data, and will not require users of the model to be aware of the details of e.g. the
tokenization scheme used for text, the indexing scheme used for categorical features,
whether image pixel values are normalized to `[-1, +1]` or to `[0, 1]`, etc. This is
especially powerful if you're exporting
your model to another runtime, such as TensorFlow.js: you won't have to
reimplement your preprocessing pipeline in JavaScript.

If you initially put your preprocessing layers in your `tf.data` pipeline,
you can export an inference model that packages the preprocessing.
Simply instantiate a new model that chains
your preprocessing layers and your training model:

```python
inputs = keras.Input(shape=input_shape)
x = preprocessing_layer(inputs)
outputs = training_model(x)
inference_model = keras.Model(inputs, outputs)
```

---
## Quick recipes

### Image data augmentation (on-device)

Note that image data augmentation layers are only active during training (similarly to
the `Dropout` layer).


```python
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Create a data augmentation stage with horizontal flipping, rotations, zooms
data_augmentation = keras.Sequential(
    [
        preprocessing.RandomFlip("horizontal"),
        preprocessing.RandomRotation(0.1),
        preprocessing.RandomZoom(0.1),
    ]
)

# Create a model that includes the augmentation stage
input_shape = (32, 32, 3)
classes = 10
inputs = keras.Input(shape=input_shape)
# Augment images
x = data_augmentation(inputs)
# Rescale image values to [0, 1]
x = preprocessing.Rescaling(1.0 / 255)(x)
# Add the rest of the model
outputs = keras.applications.ResNet50(
    weights=None, input_shape=input_shape, classes=classes
)(x)
model = keras.Model(inputs, outputs)
```

You can see a similar setup in action in the example
[image classification from scratch](https://keras.io/examples/vision/image_classification_from_scratch/).

### Normalizing numerical features


```python
# Load some data
(x_train, y_train), _ = keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()
x_train = x_train.reshape((len(x_train), -1))
input_shape = x_train.shape[1:]
classes = 10

# Create a Normalization layer and set its internal state using the training data
normalizer = preprocessing.Normalization()
normalizer.adapt(x_train)

# Create a model that include the normalization layer
inputs = keras.Input(shape=input_shape)
x = normalizer(inputs)
outputs = layers.Dense(classes, activation="softmax")(x)
model = keras.Model(inputs, outputs)

# Train the model
model.compile(optimizer="adam", loss="sparse_categorical_crossentropy")
model.fit(x_train, y_train)
```

</div>
### Encoding string categorical features via one-hot encoding


```python
# Define some toy data
data = tf.constant(["a", "b", "c", "b", "c", "a"])

# Use StringLookup to build an index of the feature values
indexer = preprocessing.StringLookup()
indexer.adapt(data)

# Use CategoryEncoding to encode the integer indices to a one-hot vector
encoder = preprocessing.CategoryEncoding(output_mode="binary")
encoder.adapt(indexer(data))

# Convert new test data (which includes unknown feature values)
test_data = tf.constant(["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", ""])
encoded_data = encoder(indexer(test_data))
print(encoded_data)
```

<div class="k-default-codeblock">
```
tf.Tensor(
[[0. 0. 0. 0. 1.]
 [0. 0. 0. 1. 0.]
 [0. 0. 1. 0. 0.]
 [0. 1. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 1. 0. 0. 0.]
 [1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]], shape=(6, 5), dtype=float32)

```
</div>
Note that index 0 is reserved for missing values (which you should specify as the empty
string `""`), and index 1 is reserved for out-of-vocabulary values (values that were not
seen during `adapt()`). You can configure this by using the `mask_token` and `oov_token`
constructor arguments  of `StringLookup`.

You can see the `StringLookup` and `CategoryEncoding` layers in action in the example
[structured data classification from scratch](https://keras.io/examples/structured_data/structured_data_classification_from_scratch/).

### Encoding integer categorical features via one-hot encoding


```python
# Define some toy data
data = tf.constant([10, 20, 20, 10, 30, 0])

# Use IntegerLookup to build an index of the feature values
indexer = preprocessing.IntegerLookup()
indexer.adapt(data)

# Use CategoryEncoding to encode the integer indices to a one-hot vector
encoder = preprocessing.CategoryEncoding(output_mode="binary")
encoder.adapt(indexer(data))

# Convert new test data (which includes unknown feature values)
test_data = tf.constant([10, 10, 20, 50, 60, 0])
encoded_data = encoder(indexer(test_data))
print(encoded_data)
```

<div class="k-default-codeblock">
```
tf.Tensor(
[[0. 0. 0. 1. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. 1. 0.]
 [0. 0. 1. 0. 0.]
 [0. 1. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 1. 0. 0. 0.]
 [1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]], shape=(6, 5), dtype=float32)

```
</div>
Note that index 0 is reserved for missing values (which you should specify as the value
0), and index 1 is reserved for out-of-vocabulary values (values that were not seen
during `adapt()`). You can configure this by using the `mask_value` and `oov_value`
constructor arguments  of `IntegerLookup`.

You can see the `IntegerLookup` and `CategoryEncoding` layers in action in the example
[structured data classification from scratch](https://keras.io/examples/structured_data/structured_data_classification_from_scratch/).

### Applying the hashing trick to an integer categorical feature

If you have a categorical feature that can take many different values (on the order of
10e3 or higher), where each value only appears a few times in the data,
it becomes impractical and ineffective to index and one-hot encode the feature values.
Instead, it can be a good idea to apply the "hashing trick": hash the values to a vector
of fixed size. This keeps the size of the feature space manageable, and removes the need
for explicit indexing.


```python
# Sample data: 10,000 random integers with values between 0 and 100,000
data = np.random.randint(0, 100000, size=(10000, 1))

# Use the Hashing layer to hash the values to the range [0, 64]
hasher = preprocessing.Hashing(num_bins=64, salt=1337)

# Use the CategoryEncoding layer to one-hot encode the hashed values
encoder = preprocessing.CategoryEncoding(max_tokens=64, output_mode="binary")
encoded_data = encoder(hasher(data))
print(encoded_data.shape)
```

<div class="k-default-codeblock">
```
(10000, 64)

```
</div>
### Encoding text as a sequence of token indices

This is how you should preprocess text to be passed to an `Embedding` layer.


```python
# Define some text data to adapt the layer
data = tf.constant(
    [
        "The Brain is wider than the Sky",
        "For put them side by side",
        "The one the other will contain",
        "With ease and You beside",
    ]
)
# Instantiate TextVectorization with "int" output_mode
text_vectorizer = preprocessing.TextVectorization(output_mode="int")
# Index the vocabulary via `adapt()`
text_vectorizer.adapt(data)

# You can retrieve the vocabulary we indexed via get_vocabulary()
vocab = text_vectorizer.get_vocabulary()
print("Vocabulary:", vocab)

# Create an Embedding + LSTM model
inputs = keras.Input(shape=(1,), dtype="string")
x = text_vectorizer(inputs)
x = layers.Embedding(input_dim=len(vocab), output_dim=64)(x)
outputs = layers.LSTM(1)(x)
model = keras.Model(inputs, outputs)

# Call the model on test data (which includes unknown tokens)
test_data = tf.constant(["The Brain is deeper than the sea"])
test_output = model(test_data)
```

<div class="k-default-codeblock">
```
Vocabulary: ['', '[UNK]', 'the', 'side', 'you', 'with', 'will', 'wider', 'them', 'than', 'sky', 'put', 'other', 'one', 'is', 'for', 'ease', 'contain', 'by', 'brain', 'beside', 'and']

```
</div>
You can see the `TextVectorization` layer in action, combined with an `Embedding` mode,
in the example
[text classification from scratch](https://keras.io/examples/nlp/text_classification_from_scratch/).

Note that when training such a model, for best performance, you should
use the `TextVectorization` layer as part of the input pipeline (which is what we
do in the text classification example above).

### Encoding text as a dense matrix of ngrams with multi-hot encoding

This is how you should preprocess text to be passed to a `Dense` layer.


```python
# Define some text data to adapt the layer
data = tf.constant(
    [
        "The Brain is wider than the Sky",
        "For put them side by side",
        "The one the other will contain",
        "With ease and You beside",
    ]
)
# Instantiate TextVectorization with "binary" output_mode (multi-hot)
# and ngrams=2 (index all bigrams)
text_vectorizer = preprocessing.TextVectorization(output_mode="binary", ngrams=2)
# Index the bigrams via `adapt()`
text_vectorizer.adapt(data)

print(
    "Encoded text:\n",
    text_vectorizer(["The Brain is deeper than the sea"]).numpy(),
    "\n",
)

# Create a Dense model
inputs = keras.Input(shape=(1,), dtype="string")
x = text_vectorizer(inputs)
outputs = layers.Dense(1)(x)
model = keras.Model(inputs, outputs)

# Call the model on test data (which includes unknown tokens)
test_data = tf.constant(["The Brain is deeper than the sea"])
test_output = model(test_data)

print("Model output:", test_output)
```

<div class="k-default-codeblock">
```
Encoded text:
 [[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.
  0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.]] 
```
</div>
    
<div class="k-default-codeblock">
```
Model output: tf.Tensor([[0.40469304]], shape=(1, 1), dtype=float32)

```
</div>
### Encoding text as a dense matrix of ngrams with TF-IDF weighting

This is an alternative way of preprocessing text before passing it to a `Dense` layer.


```python
# Define some text data to adapt the layer
data = tf.constant(
    [
        "The Brain is wider than the Sky",
        "For put them side by side",
        "The one the other will contain",
        "With ease and You beside",
    ]
)
# Instantiate TextVectorization with "tf-idf" output_mode
# (multi-hot with TF-IDF weighting) and ngrams=2 (index all bigrams)
text_vectorizer = preprocessing.TextVectorization(output_mode="tf-idf", ngrams=2)
# Index the bigrams and learn the TF-IDF weights via `adapt()`
text_vectorizer.adapt(data)

print(
    "Encoded text:\n",
    text_vectorizer(["The Brain is deeper than the sea"]).numpy(),
    "\n",
)

# Create a Dense model
inputs = keras.Input(shape=(1,), dtype="string")
x = text_vectorizer(inputs)
outputs = layers.Dense(1)(x)
model = keras.Model(inputs, outputs)

# Call the model on test data (which includes unknown tokens)
test_data = tf.constant(["The Brain is deeper than the sea"])
test_output = model(test_data)
print("Model output:", test_output)
```

<div class="k-default-codeblock">
```
Encoded text:
