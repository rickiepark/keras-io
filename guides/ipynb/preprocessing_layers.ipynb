    "If you have a categorical feature that can take many different values (on the order of\n",

    "it becomes impractical and ineffective to index and one-hot encode the feature values.\n",
    "Instead, it can be a good idea to apply the \"hashing trick\": hash the values to a vector\n",
    "of fixed size. This keeps the size of the feature space manageable, and removes the need\n",
