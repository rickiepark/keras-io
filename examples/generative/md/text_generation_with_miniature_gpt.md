**Description:** Implement miniature version of GPT and learn to generate text.

---
## Introduction

This example demonstrates autoregressive language modelling using
a miniature version of GPT model.
The model consists of a single transformer block with causal masking
in its attention layer.
We use the text from IMDB sentiment classification dataset for training
and generate new movie reviews for a given prompt.
When using this script with your own data, make sure it has at least
1M words.

This example should be run with `tf-nightly>=2.3.0-dev20200531` or
with TensorFlow 2.3 or higher.

## Self-attention with causal masking

We compute self-attention as usual, but prevent any information to flow
from future tokens by masking the upper half of the scaled dot product matrix.



```python

class MultiHeadSelfAttention(layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, embed_dim, num_heads=8):
        super(MultiHeadSelfAttention, self).__init__()
        self.embed_dim = embed_dim
        self.num_heads = num_heads
        if embed_dim % num_heads != 0:
            raise ValueError(
                f"embedding dimension = {embed_dim} should be divisible by number of heads = {num_heads}"
            )
        self.projection_dim = embed_dim // num_heads
        self.query_dense = layers.Dense(embed_dim)
        self.key_dense = layers.Dense(embed_dim)
        self.value_dense = layers.Dense(embed_dim)
        self.combine_heads = layers.Dense(embed_dim)

    @staticmethod
    def causal_attention_mask(n_dest, n_src, dtype):
        """
        1's in the lower triangle, counting from the lower right corner.
        """
        i = tf.range(n_dest)[:, None]
        j = tf.range(n_src)
        m = i >= j - n_src + n_dest
        return tf.cast(m, dtype)

    def attention(self, query, key, value):
        score = tf.matmul(query, key, transpose_b=True)
        dim_key = tf.cast(tf.shape(key)[-1], tf.float32)
        scaled_score = score / tf.math.sqrt(dim_key)

        # prevent information flow from future tokens
        shape = tf.shape(scaled_score)
        dim_dest, dim_src = shape[2], shape[3]
        attention_mask = self.causal_attention_mask(
            dim_dest, dim_src, scaled_score.dtype
        )
        attention_mask = tf.reshape(attention_mask, [1, 1, dim_dest, dim_src])
        scaled_score = scaled_score * attention_mask - 1e4 * (1 - attention_mask)

        weights = tf.nn.softmax(scaled_score, axis=-1)
        output = tf.matmul(weights, value)
        return output, weights

    def separate_heads(self, x, batch_size):
        x = tf.reshape(x, (batch_size, -1, self.num_heads, self.projection_dim))
        return tf.transpose(x, perm=[0, 2, 1, 3])

    def call(self, inputs):
        # x.shape = [batch_size, seq_len, embedding_dim]
        batch_size = tf.shape(inputs)[0]
        query = self.query_dense(inputs)  # (batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim)
        key = self.key_dense(inputs)  # (batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim)
        value = self.value_dense(inputs)  # (batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim)
        query = self.separate_heads(
            query, batch_size
        )  # (batch_size, num_heads, seq_len, projection_dim)
        key = self.separate_heads(
            key, batch_size
        )  # (batch_size, num_heads, seq_len, projection_dim)
        value = self.separate_heads(
            value, batch_size
        )  # (batch_size, num_heads, seq_len, projection_dim)
        attention, weights = self.attention(query, key, value)
        attention = tf.transpose(
            attention, perm=[0, 2, 1, 3]
        )  # (batch_size, seq_len, num_heads, projection_dim)
        concat_attention = tf.reshape(
            attention, (batch_size, -1, self.embed_dim)
        )  # (batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim)
        output = self.combine_heads(
            concat_attention
        )  # (batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim)
        return output


```

## Implement a Transformer block as a layer



```python

class TransformerBlock(layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, embed_dim, num_heads, ff_dim, rate=0.1):
        super(TransformerBlock, self).__init__()
        self.att = MultiHeadSelfAttention(embed_dim, num_heads)
        self.ffn = keras.Sequential(
            [layers.Dense(ff_dim, activation="relu"), layers.Dense(embed_dim),]
        )
        self.layernorm1 = layers.LayerNormalization(epsilon=1e-6)
        self.layernorm2 = layers.LayerNormalization(epsilon=1e-6)
        self.dropout1 = layers.Dropout(rate)
        self.dropout2 = layers.Dropout(rate)

    def call(self, inputs):
        attention_output = self.att(inputs)
        attention_output = self.dropout1(attention_output)
        out1 = self.layernorm1(inputs + attention_output)
        ffn_output = self.ffn(out1)
        ffn_output = self.dropout2(ffn_output)
        return self.layernorm2(out1 + ffn_output)


```

---
## Implement embedding layer

Two seperate embedding layers, one for tokens, one for token index (positions).



```python

class TokenAndPositionEmbedding(layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, maxlen, vocab_size, embed_dim):
        super(TokenAndPositionEmbedding, self).__init__()
        self.token_emb = layers.Embedding(input_dim=vocab_size, output_dim=embed_dim)
        self.pos_emb = layers.Embedding(input_dim=maxlen, output_dim=embed_dim)

    def call(self, x):
        maxlen = tf.shape(x)[-1]
        positions = tf.range(start=0, limit=maxlen, delta=1)
        positions = self.pos_emb(positions)
        x = self.token_emb(x)
        return x + positions


```

---
## Implement miniature GPT model



```python
vocab_size = 20000  # Only consider the top 20k words
maxlen = 100  # Max sequence size
embed_dim = 256  # Embedding size for each token
num_heads = 2  # Number of attention heads
feed_forward_dim = 256  # Hidden layer size in feed forward network inside transformer


def create_model():
    inputs = layers.Input(shape=(maxlen,), dtype=tf.int32)
    embedding_layer = TokenAndPositionEmbedding(maxlen, vocab_size, embed_dim)
    x = embedding_layer(inputs)
    transformer_block = TransformerBlock(embed_dim, num_heads, feed_forward_dim)
    x = transformer_block(x)
    outputs = layers.Dense(vocab_size)(x)
    model = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=[outputs, x])
    loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True)
    model.compile(
        "adam", loss=[loss_fn, None],
    )  # No loss and optimization based on word embeddings from transformer block
    return model


```

## Prepare data for word level language modelling

We will download IMDB data, and combine training and validation sets for
text generation task.



```python
!curl -O https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/aclImdb_v1.tar.gz
!tar -xf aclImdb_v1.tar.gz

```

```python

batch_size = 32

    for f in os.listdir(dir):

random.shuffle(filenames)
text_ds = tf.data.TextLineDataset(filenames)
text_ds = text_ds.shuffle(buffer_size=256)
text_ds = text_ds.batch(batch_size)


def custom_standardization(input_string):
    """ Remove html line-break tags and handle punctuation """
    lowercased = tf.strings.lower(input_string)
    stripped_html = tf.strings.regex_replace(lowercased, "<br />", " ")
    return tf.strings.regex_replace(stripped_html, f"([{string.punctuation}])", r" \1")


# Create vectcorization layer and adapt it to the text
vectorize_layer = TextVectorization(
    standardize=custom_standardization,
    max_tokens=vocab_size - 1,
    output_mode="int",
    output_sequence_length=maxlen + 1,
)
vectorize_layer.adapt(text_ds)
vocab = vectorize_layer.get_vocabulary()  # To get words back from token indices


def prepare_lm_inputs_labels(text):
    """
    Shift word sequences by 1 position so that the target for position (i) is
    word at position (i+1). The model will use all words up till position (i)
    to predict the next word.
    """
    text = tf.expand_dims(text, -1)
    tokenized_sentences = vectorize_layer(text)
    x = tokenized_sentences[:, :-1]
    y = tokenized_sentences[:, 1:]
    return x, y


text_ds = text_ds.map(prepare_lm_inputs_labels)
text_ds = text_ds.prefetch(tf.data.experimental.AUTOTUNE)
